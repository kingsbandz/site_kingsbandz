I am an avid fan of puzzles. Here are a couple of books that have I have thouroughly enjoyed solving:
* 'Mathematical Puzzles : A Connoisseur's Collection' by Peter Winkler [[link]](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Mathematical_Puzzles/fiipDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0){:target="_blank"}
* 'Problem-Solving Strategies' by Arthur Engel [[link]](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Problem_Solving_Strategies/IJLzBwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0){:target="_blank"}

Aside from this, the Ted-Ed Riddles[[link]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJicmE8fK0EimY5ZyoyJ39IClMnOqqVXN) Youtube channel is also highly recommended!
