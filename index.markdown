I am a researcher interested in theoretical computer science and information theory, currently at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, India. I am broadly interested in questions with a probabilistic flavour, particularly in classical and quantum information theory and also in sampling algorithms.
My CV can be found [here](/images/cv_Sayantan.pdf){:target="_blank"} and my research statement can be found [here](/images/Research_statement_Sayantan.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The main focus of my research so far has been towards:
*  Designing efficient protocols for entanglement transmission over quantum networks (for e.g. the quantum multiple access channel).
*  Constructing *perfect* sampling algorithms i.e. algorithms that can produce a sample from a distribution over some combinatorial structure with zero error in total variation, in polynomial time.

I have been fortunate enough to be able to work on the problems related to quantum information theory with my advisor [Pranab Sen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ka5re30AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. I have also collaborated  with [Siddharth Bhandari](https://sites.google.com/view/siddharth-bhandari/home){:target="_blank"} on questions related to sampling algorithms.
